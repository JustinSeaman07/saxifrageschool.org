        <h2> The Pittsburgh Forum</h2>

        <p>We're happy to announce the first annual Pittsburgh Forum, an academic residency focused on the intersection of theory and practice. The PghForum will be launching on the East End of Pittsburgh from <strong>August 9-12, 2013</strong>. This year's weekend-long academic residency is themed on “Our Life in Schools”. We will gather together and ask big questions on the past and present purpose of education, and how that purpose should inform its ongoing reform. The discussion on school will framed  by this basic design method: 'The "How?" must come from the "Why?"'</p><h4> Come talk, eat, read, listen, and work with 15 colleagues and ask these important questions concerning our lives in schools.
        <h2>See our <a href="forum2013.html">participant list </a>here.</h2>

        <img src="images/cloudlights.jpg">
      <h4>The Experience</h4>
        <p>The Pittsburgh Forum is designed to be an immersive intellectual experience for participants featuring a series of guest speakers and small community projects, as well as allotted time for personal reading and reflection in addition to participant reflection presentations. This program will mirror a traditional academic residency in rigor and thoughtfulness while intentionally expanding the experience to include hands-on projects and activities that reflect both the theory and practice of our theme.</p> <p>For most of us, we spent 20+ years in school always with an eye torward the future. We want to address, head on, the tension between "life" and "life in school". Is the schooled life really <em>life</em>? Is it just preparation to live better <em>after</em> we graduate? How do we reconcile or understand the distinction between school and the rest of life? During this short residency will ask these questions on the purpose of education and the relationship between school and life. We will engage with a number of texts, a range of guest speakers, human-centered design sessions, and work on a small neighborhood project. Residents will live together for 4 days in a large Victorian home in Pittsburgh’s historic Highland Park neighborhood.</p>

        <img width="200" src="http://thoreau.eserver.org/sophia3.jpg"><p>This seminal work gets to the heart of the distinction between school and life, between preparation and what it means to truly live. Though flawed in both theory and practice, Thoreau's writing at Walden asks "Why?" as good as any:  <em>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to confront only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. <strong>I did not wish to live what was not life</strong>"</em> Excerpts from Chapters 1 & 2.</p>

        <p>a recently popular book on the value of manual labor over purely theoretical knowledge. Author Michael Crawford (who has a background working in think tanks and and as a fellow in the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture while also owning an operating a motorcycle repair shop) makes an impassioned case for shop class and blue collar work instead of what he sees as an educational system focused on churning out "knowledge workers" or "symbolic analysts" who sit at desks and deal in only in ideas. He calls for the more students and workers to achieve self-mastery through "hard disciplines" like gardening, learning a language, or learning to properly clean an engine.</p>
