          <p class="aligncenter"><strong>Early years:</strong> Youngest in class, first day jokes about my last name, fast reader, called pig-headed. <strong>Middle years:</strong> Tall and gawky, hated phys-ed, submitted first word-processed research paper at my high-school. <strong>Later years:</strong> Failed first attempt at college, two years off, went back and worked my way through, graduated debt-free.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">Andrea was a stereotypical over-achiever throughout grade school. She went on to the University of Pittsburgh, and after five years and four transfers, she still does not have a degree. Andrea plans on returning to school this fall for an Associate's degree in graphic communications.</p>

          <h4 class="aligncenter">Parker Shaw</h4>
          <p class="aligncenter">I made it all the way to high school graduation without learning how to study, and without being convinced that I needed to do it, but I enjoyed my classes on art and literature enough to keep me engaged. It wasn't until may last two years of college that I finally began to catch the vision of studying (even in topics I enjoy), but I finally learned to sit and think (outside of class) long enough to start actually educating myself somewhat.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">My primary and secondary education took place across eight different states. While a student, there were very few labels, both positive and negative, that were not applied to me. In the last ten years, I was a freelance web designer, an art curator and preparator, and now I teach at a regional state university.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">I was the last person in my class to be admitted into the Young Pioneer Organization of the Soviet Union because my father taught math at an American university and upon his return he flunked an answer in front of all my classmates about which country is better. Twenty five years later I found myself walking away from a tenure track teaching position with no regrets. Currently, I am soul searching.</p></p>

          <p class="aligncenter">Born and raised in Missouri, I had a wonderful time living and learning in schools. I was able to draw connections between my interests and what I saw around me in my life and what I was learning in school. I currently teach Spanish teacher at City Charter High School, where I aim to use the world as a classroom.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">I was a day-dreamer in school. Early school memories: country dancing (I grew up in England) and being rapped over the knuckles with a wooden ruler for talking during a test – I was 5 for goodness sake. Best subjects: anything I could understand visually or through a story, loved history, geography and biology. I wanted to be a veterinarian but that ambition died the day I was told that you have to clip rabbit’s incisors because they keep on growing if you don’t! Left school at 16 because I just couldn't be there any more. Went to art college. When I graduated I didn't know what to do for income but I knew I didn't want to teach. However, 30 years, and grad school, later, I find I love teaching for the change and growth I can facilitate in my students, but am weary of the institutional structures and procedures that often obstruct the process of learning, while professing the opposite.</p>

          <h4 class="aligncenter">Sara Mastros</h4>
          <p class="aligncenter">I enjoyed elementary school, but was bullied (hard) in middle school, and was thoroughly bored in high school. I went to Caltech, and then to Pitt, to be a theoretical math professor, without ever really thinking about why I was doing such a thing. Now I teach math (and sometimes philosophy) at a tiny "start up" high school, which I love.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">Kathryn has been in school (and more or less thrilled about it) since she was four. She grew up in Houston, went to High School at a religious private school in St Louis, graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 2005, spending her Junior year abroad at St Hilda's College, Oxford University, and went straight into the PhD program in Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh. She teaches and TAs undergraduate classes in the Philosophy Department at Pitt and, with any luck, she'll defend her dissertation on norms and what has to be true of something for it to be the sort of thing that can be better or worse in January of 2014. </p>

          <h4 class="aligncenter">David Stehouwer</h4>
          <p class="aligncenter">Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the youngest of three. After graduating from Calvin College with a degree in math education, he moved with 10 other pals to Pittsburgh. Today, he teaches middle school math and science at Pittsburgh Urban Christian School, and spends most of his free time renovating a 100-year-old Victorian home in Highland Park where he lives with his wife, Jenna, and dog, Wellington.</p>

          <p class="aligncenter">Homeschooled, but turned out just fine. Loved every bit of college until I realized I couldn't <em>make</em> anything. Sometimes I just want to go back to being a student, I'm much better at that than anything else.</p>
