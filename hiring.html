<h3>
 Help us re-think Higher Education.</h3><h3>We're looking for renaissance thinkers (and makers) to help us grow our programs in the following areas:</h3>


<!--<h3>Carpentry Instructor</h3>
  <p>The second facilitator for our ongoing short and long-term carpentry courses. Applicant should have:</p>
    <ul>
   <li>some experience in teaching or leading groups in carpentry projects.
  <li>3+ years of professional carpentry experience, with a specialty in either fine woodworking, or residential construction.</li>
  <li>some experience in the design and philosophy side of the trade; able to lead discussions and close-readings of theoretical texts on the purpose, history, and method of carpentry as craft</li>
</ul>


    <h5>Position runs on contract on a per-course basis; the next 12-week course could run from August - October. Each course offers roughly 10 hours per week for 12 weeks. Some shorter courses (5-6 weeks) and one-day workshops are also a possibility.<h5>
      <h5>To inquire, please send a short message with your resume to <a href="mailto:tim@saxifrageschool.org">tim@saxifrageschool.org</a></h5>-->

 

<h3>Dev. Year Instructors</h3>
  <p>Twelve-week course instructors for our nine-month program "Dev.Year", a full-fledged Web Developer training program. The program offers 3 terms of successive twelve-week courses. Opporunities are available to see in all 3 consecutive terms. We're looking for someone who wants to set the direction for this program's curriculum and is interested in helping us develop the CS program at the Saxifrage School. Applicant should have some of the following:</p>
    <ul>
  <li>4+ years of professional CS and Web Development experience.</li>
  <li>Full stack experience, with specific knowledge of Web Development: HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, and Python or Ruby</li>
  <li>Experience with Git, Github, Terminal, and Heroku (or something similar) for version control and hosting</li>
  <li>Open-source project experience</li>
  <li>Interest in the design and philosophy behind CS and ability to lead discussions and close-readings on theoretical texts</li> 
  <li>Some experience in teaching or leading groups in CS projects is preferred.</li>
</ul>


    <h5>Position is a temporary 12-week contract (possibly for 3 consecutive 12-week terms). The courses will be part of our <a href="http://www.devyear.com/">Dev.Year </a>program and run for nine months starting Fall 2014. Instructor workloads are generally no more than 6 - 9 hours per week, light enough that those with full-time employment could teach with us on the side. We're especially looking for active professionals with expertise to share. Come help us teach a new generation to build the web!<h5>
      <h5>To inquire, please send a short message with your resume to <a href="mailto:tim@saxifrageschool.org">tim@saxifrageschool.org</a></h5>


<h3>Spanish Instructor</h3>
  <p>The primary facilitator for a future Spanish language course. This will be our first Spanish-language prototype as we work towards a four-year all-school program in the future. This program will blend digital learning tools (like those made by our friends at <a href="http://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a>) with peer learning, brief traditional instruction, and lots of face-to-face experience living in the language alongside native speakers.
    Applicant should have some of the following:</p>
    <ul>
   <li>A vision for improving University-level language instruction.</li>
  <li>2+ years of previous Spanish language teaching experience.</li>
  <li>Connections to the local Spanish-speaking community.</li>
  <li>Interest in helping us prototype this new course concept and working through the problems that will arise.</li>
</ul>


    <h5>Position runs on contract on a per-course basis; the course will be part of our 2014 program schedule and run sometime mid-late 2014. The instructor will be hired, at minimum for the duration of this course. Subsequent opportunities are likely.<h5>
      <h5>To inquire, please send a short message with your resume to <a href="mailto:tim@saxifrageschool.org">tim@saxifrageschool.org</a></h5>


<h3>Arduino Instructor</h3>
  <p>The primary facilitator for a future Arduino course. We're rookies in the Arduino field, so you'll be responsible for helping plan the curriculum. The rough concept is that it will incorporate both the theory and practice, teaching students both how to use Arduino tech, but also understand its importance and potentials for application.
    Applicant should have:</p>
    <ul>
   <li>some experience in teaching or leading groups in mapping projects.
  <li>Serious arduino skills, as demonstrated by a portfolio of multiple projects.</li>
  <li>Cutting-edge knowledge of the newest ardunio capabilities and projects.</li>
  <li>Interest in helping us prototype this new course concept and working through the problems that will arise.</li>
</ul>


    <h5>Position runs on contract on a per-course basis; the course will be part of our <a href="http://www.devyear.com/">Dev.Year </a>program and run sometime late 2014. The instructor will be hired, at minimum for the duration of this course. Subsequent opportunities are likely.<h5>
      <h5>To inquire, please send a short message with your resume to <a href="mailto:tim@saxifrageschool.org">tim@saxifrageschool.org</a></h5>
